QubeFS is a closed project simply because the goal changed for this project. Originally I wrote this as a de-duplicated backup filesystem that could be used with Bacula, Borg, Amanda, etc. Backup images would be deduplicated on the underlying storage. There are a ton of backup FSs out there, none written in C++, and at the time I was looking for something relatively simply to spend time on. However, as I began playing with this, suddenly I began to have ideas far beyond my station as the design for HiveFS started growing in my mind. This was never meant to be more than an academic project, so I closed it and began work on HiveFS because I apparently had a giant sado-masochistic streak and wanted to be beaten and humiliated by doubly-linked kernel lists and inode details.
